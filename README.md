This is a Lab project of my Python course, it wa not hard but I got 0 at first beacuse the the score was given by AI

I add an extra line at the start which enable me to open the file quickly.

However, due to the difference between the structure of mac and school's ubuntu system, AI cannot scan my homework so I got 0

Fortunately, I argue for my lab project and get my full mark back.

If you want to download it, just enter git clone https://github.com/Qlinaq/Robot_Game_Mazes.git in your mac terminal
